## Summary

## Meeting Purpose

[Define a strategy for FFCI's urgent mobile app launch.](https://fathom.video/share/Nax167mBHtfdB7xkQAyXjCDfNey-_8oX?tab=summary&timestamp=59.0)

## Key Takeaways

  - [**Urgent Deadline:** FFCI's SubSplash app expires Jan 15. The client needs a replacement by late Feb/early Mar for an upcoming event.](https://fathom.video/share/Nax167mBHtfdB7xkQAyXjCDfNey-_8oX?tab=summary&timestamp=59.0)
  - [**Scope Conflict:** The SOW promised a simple app pulling from the website. The current SubSplash app has custom features (Bible integration, notes) not on the site, creating a scope mismatch.](https://fathom.video/share/Nax167mBHtfdB7xkQAyXjCDfNey-_8oX?tab=summary&timestamp=287.0)
  - [**Two-Phase Plan:** Launch a core app (pulling from the website) by the client's deadline, then address custom features as a separate, potentially paid, phase.](https://fathom.video/share/Nax167mBHtfdB7xkQAyXjCDfNey-_8oX?tab=summary&timestamp=1043.0)
  - [**Mitigation Strategy:** Explore a month-to-month SubSplash extension to buy time. If viable, Five Q may absorb the cost (~$500/mo) to manage the client relationship.](https://fathom.video/share/Nax167mBHtfdB7xkQAyXjCDfNey-_8oX?tab=summary&timestamp=1796.0)

## Transcript

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:00): We had a pediatrician, and she couldn't figure it out.

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:02): And then I think someone sent pictures to a dermatologist, and they finally all put their heads together to figure out what was going on.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:00:12): Man.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:14): Hey, guys.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:16): Hey, Mike.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:17): Sorry, I'm a minute here late.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:00:21): You're fine.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:22): How's the day going?

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:24): It's good.

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:27): How are you feeling?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:29): Better, but still got a lot of brain fog going on today, so that kind of post-sickness murkiness.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:37): I had a fever up until yesterday morning, so it's lasted way longer than I anticipated, which kind of sucked.

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:45): Oh, yeah.

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:46): That's awful.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:47): What were you saying?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:47): I cut you off.

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:48): I was going to say I got brain fog anyway on Monday.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:51): Just typical Monday brain fog.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:55): It's true.**Adam Hardy** (00:00:00): We had a pediatrician, and she couldn't figure it out. And then I think someone sent pictures to a dermatologist, and they finally all put their heads together to figure out what was going on.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:00:12): Man.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:14): Hey, guys. Hey, Mike. Sorry, I'm a minute here late.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:00:21): You're fine.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:22): How's the day going?

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:24): It's good. How are you feeling?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:29): Better, but still got a lot of brain fog going on today, so that kind of post-sickness murkiness. I had a fever up until yesterday morning, so it's lasted way longer than I anticipated, which kind of sucked.

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:45): Oh, yeah. That's awful.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:47): What were you saying? I cut you off.

**Adam Hardy** (00:00:48): I was going to say I got brain fog anyway on Monday.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:00:51): Just typical Monday brain fog. It's true. I got a hard stop here at the top of the hour for another a day. So I'd love to just jump right into FFCI, if you guys don't mind. I think you both saw Mike Bell's message, but basically, they're shutting down SubSplash on January 15th, which means they need a website launched, and if we can, which isn't going to happen, the app. I told him that we couldn't meet that deadline. He was disappointed, and he was hoping for maybe end of February or early March because they got something coming up. So, and we can make, I mean, he claimed that he had hit every deadline that we gave him, which is not 100% true, and even the stuff he provided to us wasn't adequate, right? mean, like, we know that the less they give us and the less guidance they give us, the harder it is, and it slows everything down. So between that and C4I and Humanitas, I mean, there's a variety of reasons why we're behind. I didn't want to get into that with him because for me, it's just not worth it to me. To try to justify our work, I think the best we can do is just try to accommodate. So I'm confident that we can get something up website-wise, but I do want to try to at least get the ball rolling on the app if we can to hit like that end of February, beginning of March, best we can.

**Adam Hardy** (00:02:21): Just getting that date again, when are they getting rid of SubSplash?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:02:27): January 15th, I believe.

**Adam Hardy** (00:02:28): Oh, we'll have the website done completely by then.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:02:31): Websites should be fine, yeah. Yeah, but that will make their app non-existent. So, yeah, so I don't know, and this is where my own ignorance comes into play. I don't know how this all works from the tech side of things. I know when they shut off SubSplash, their app will stop working. I But, Adam, I set up a task for you, and it looks like you got some time into it just to kind of evaluate their current app and see what needs to happen on the website. Because, Anthony, if I recall correctly, you were saying certain pages or things need to be done design-wise and template-wise for us to start in on the app. And, Adam, I just asked you to kind of go look into their current app and see what needs to happen on the website to make progress or at least start on the app.

**Adam Hardy** (00:03:33): Yeah, like their app isn't really, there's not really a ton to it, although it's not set up in a direct relationship to their current site. Like, they have sections that they don't really have. Sure, they have what? Sections that they don't really have on the current site. It's kind of organized differently. So I don't know how big of a deal that is. Is the only thing that I really thought stood out is they have like a Bible integration with their app, and then they also have the blue letter Bible. That might just be a link though. Yeah, that looks like it's just a link out too. But they do have some kind of, I don't know what they're using for the Bible integration, but. It's integrated into their app. There's also a way that you can like leave, I think there's like notes you can take inside of them and link on different pages.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:04:47): Did we, Mike, did we have any calls with them? Like discovery calls around what's going to go into the mobile app?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:04:54): We did have a discovery call at one point, but I don't think we talked about the mobile app. And of course, our statement of work is not very specific, unfortunately. I mean, it does say that it's going to be built to pull content directly from the website. And so this is my concern is that we're going to honor that arrangement and it's not going be good enough for them because this current app might be better than what we might be able to provide for them if there's these extra things.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:05:29): You know, right.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:05:31): Let me see if I can pull up.

**Adam Hardy** (00:05:34): It's just set up very resource oriented, right?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:05:37): Which would make sense for an app. We're going into their contents there to see if there is anything on the discovery questions.

**Adam Hardy** (00:05:49): I believe Micah was there, but he had very few questions, I think. And it was mostly around, I think, the Bible integration. Connect, oh, that's just their social media. I think the note thing is the only thing that looks somewhat interesting, and it doesn't seem to work when I click. Oh, no, there it is.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:06:19): Are they notes in the Bible?

**Adam Hardy** (00:06:21): No, this is separate of the Bible. This is just, like, on any page. I'm testing it out right now. Oh, test, test. So when I come back to it, there's still a note, I guess. Yeah. And then I can share that note if I want, or delete that note. I don't know how important that is to them, because I don't see the functionality being. don't how them. them. know know that that is is that is to

**Anthony Elliott** (00:07:02): I feel like I've had this conversation two or three times, and every time I'm like, what does the app do, and like, what's actually a value from the app?

**Adam Hardy** (00:07:11): I would say access to their resources and the Bible integration is probably...

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:07:21): Could we add them to just replicate what they currently have on their app, less the third-party integrations? Just pull the pages that are already on their mobile app?

**Adam Hardy** (00:07:34): What I can do is I can look at the structure here, see if anything can be condensed, gotten rid of, but yeah.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:07:42): I did find the discovery call, and there was conversation about the app.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:07:49): Do you want to send us that, um, that link?

**Adam Hardy** (00:07:55): Yep.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:07:58): And chat.

**Adam Hardy** (00:08:00): There's also on there events you can add to calendar, which we probably could do. I don't know how it works. FFC would like full access to your calendar.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:08:29): Mike, did you send that Fathom call?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:08:32): Yeah, it's in Zoom chat. Oh, gosh, I do this all the time now. There is like this AI feature in Zoom that I turn on.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:08:40): Oh, yeah. It looks identical to the chat.

**Adam Hardy** (00:08:43): You write it in there?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:08:44): So I send it to the AI companion instead, thinking I'm sending it to the chat.

**Adam Hardy** (00:08:55): I mean, this makes sense, the way this is set up. I would probably... ahead. Hello, is a?! I'm Make it in a way that's a little bit better, but, because really, if you're on the app, you're probably already a member. Yeah, otherwise you wouldn't download it. Download it. So everything for you would be more around resources. And then that Bible integration. I wonder if, does he have any data that he can send us, or has he sent us any data on usage on that? I'm sure Subsplash has analytics and stuff.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:09:53): No, and I'm wondering if maybe we can get on a call once we just do another. about Okay. Hour long, hey, let's just talk about the app and what you think is a necessity. But I want the contractor, whoever has a contractor on that call too.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:10:18): Yeah, that would be ideal.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:10:24): But part of my question is, Adam, do we have enough on the website to move forward with development of the app? Oh, yeah.

**Adam Hardy** (00:10:34): Yeah, and plus you have the mobile app itself. If we're not pulling, I mean, I guess it depends on how we're building it. If we're pulling straight from the MIP platform.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:10:49): Yeah, the spirit that Chad is hoping for, and that's why he put the price point down low, is that this would be pulling content only. we're we're From the website, and no custom content on the app.

**Adam Hardy** (00:11:05): Right. Would it look the same, though, and be organized the same, or would it just... I guess I haven't seen how a MIP translates into a mobile app.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:11:17): Yeah, me either. I think that's what we need to... It doesn't have to be exactly the same. Like, if we had some... Like, on C4i, we talked about that.

**Adam Hardy** (00:11:31): like, built-in control, like, inside of the dashboard of Kirby that says this is a mobile... This should be included on the mobile app? This shouldn't be included on the mobile... Like, that, like... There'd be some things I would think you need on them.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:11:47): Yeah, I... Like, let me pick on C4i. That's a better example. When we're building an app for C4i, they're very video-focused. So we don't need to... The website's there for a reason. We don't... We need to replicate everything in the website on the app. We should make the app more engaging for people so they come back. So we can make the app more really focused around the video collections and get people into that. So the content can pull from the website, but there's some, you know, it's faster, faster to load, gets people to come back.

**Adam Hardy** (00:12:23): Is there anything like that for FFCI? Then it's going to be the resources and the events, it looks like to me.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:12:31): Based on their current setup, their current app.

**Adam Hardy** (00:12:34): They're set up in a much better way here.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:12:37): I was going to say their app looks better than the website. And so when Mike said that they've had great success with their app, it doesn't surprise me. Because their website's some hot garbage.

**Adam Hardy** (00:12:50): I might take some of what I see here on the website to organize their resources now, because that makes way more sense. They didn't even have us any organization to their resources. close drought. that

**Anthony Elliott** (00:13:05): So the app can have resources, it can have events.

**Adam Hardy** (00:13:09): There's these random audio messages. I don't know if those are on the current site. It's hidden somewhere or what. I'm going to click on one so excuse the noise if it comes through. Matt, hold your hand up, will you? Yeah, so we'd have to create an audio collection for those if they wanted to move those in. I also have videos here. Which we would have to create a video collection for.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:14:15): So Mike, my pain point, if we bring a contractor on for a one-hour call, in order to bring a contractor on, I want to give them a price. Here's what Five Q will pay you to build out this app, and here are the key features that the app will have. So I want to know, I need to have that defined before I pull someone in.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:14:39): Yeah, and I think we've got freedom in the scope, only in that the arrangements are, I mean, what was communicated to the client in the arrangements, and I think verbally, was that this really is going to be connected to your website. It's going to be whatever's on the website, it's to be pulled into your app. So. So. Um, As far as financially is concerned, we're doing all right. We're not going to hit profitability on the project when you account for the app, but we did. Let's see here. It's more website related. Hold on one second. We did charge them like 30,000.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:15:28): It wasn't that much. Okay. It was 12,000 for the mobile app.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:15:34): So we could go by that number and be like, you know, if they're willing to do a fixed price. And even if we got 20% profit margin on that, you know, offer them nine grand to do the app. That might be high. I don't know. I don't know.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:15:52): Yeah, I think the C4i app I'm comfortable with, which is a little simpler with like a seven or 8,000. But that, so that works.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:16:06): Whatever we can do on FFCI to set the framework so that it's easier on C4I, we can make up that profitability also is what I'm saying.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:16:15): Okay. So.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:16:18): Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:16:18): Yeah. So my main concern is maybe that doesn't leave me room for custom features like a Bible app or notes.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:16:29): Yeah, we didn't promise that either, which is going to be a pain point, I think.

**Adam Hardy** (00:16:37): I don't think the notes will be such a problem, but I would imagine the Bible integration.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:16:47): Especially since we're so far removed from when the agreement was signed, Mike Bell's not going to remember what was communicated to him. So, um, I'm okay, like sticking to what's in the agreement. Yeah. But it's going to be a fight later. Maybe we just say, like, hey, this is what we agreed to. We can do the Bible integration, but if you want it sooner, it's not going to happen, and we're going to have to charge extra for it.

**Adam Hardy** (00:17:18): I wonder what it's using. it just using...

**Anthony Elliott** (00:17:23): Yeah, taking payment out of it, if I just say, you know, we can move forward on the website. like, if it's on the website, we can make it appear on the app, no custom features. We can get that launched soon, sooner. And then we can come back with a second round of adding in the Bible app integration. That might have to be paid. They might have to pay for that.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:17:44): Yep. I would say time is of the essence. So I would say let's just move forward with that plan and address that discussion with Mike later when we do, like, a mobile app handoff or a review. Just explain it, like, hey, this is what the agreement said. This will... We're going by, we understand that there's some custom, you know, there's some things in your current app that would be custom. And if you want this app, you know, for your timeline, it's not going to happen. So, and I think, once again, it'll be a pain point. I think he'll accept it.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:18:22): I'm good with that. Okay, so then I could bring on a contractor. If we even need to have a call with a client on that.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:18:34): Yeah, and I don't, to be honest with you, I don't think we need a call yet. We're going to after we get some work done and want him to review it. But I'm not sure we need to rehash. The direction was set pretty clear early on. It's your app's going to reflect us on the website. Whether Mike remembers that or not. And so, if our first pass is presenting that to him, I think that's good enough. It's Thank Especially if we're going to hit the deadline.

**Adam Hardy** (00:19:04): Interesting. Their search on their app lets you filter by topic, speaker, scripture.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:19:14): In what? What do they have that can search? Searches media.

**Adam Hardy** (00:19:19): Again, those videos and the audio that we don't have on the...

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:19:23): I was going to say, we're just linking out to that, right? But isn't their current site linking out to that? That's interesting. They don't have any audio and video.

**Adam Hardy** (00:19:32): It's only on the app. So we need to either move that over so it's accessible. I mean, that's not a big deal. We can get Sydney on moving.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:19:43): Sure. Here's the thing.

**Adam Hardy** (00:19:44): We don't have access to it if it's not on the web.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:19:47): Yeah.

**Adam Hardy** (00:19:48): I don't know. And maybe you can download it here.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:19:53): Well, okay. Maybe we should have a call with him then ahead of time and just say, Hey, look, what's... on the app that you feel is, oh, I hate this project so much.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:20:10): Because he's going to say, want all of it.

**Adam Hardy** (00:20:12): want everything.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:20:13): want everything.

**Adam Hardy** (00:20:13): You can download it. And there's not, I don't think there's a ton. I shouldn't say that because I don't know.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:20:20): We don't, we can say, you know, in order to feature these things, we need, we need to act, we need access to the content. And we can always come back post-launch and do other things.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:20:33): I mean, if it's going to be a fight, and Mike Bell is going to be a hard, you know what, about it, like, sometimes I'm okay just giving in to the client and just say, whatever, we'll do it. But I think right now he cares more about having something up by that time, preferably by January 15th, which is probably not going to happen, especially with the holidays.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:20:55): Right.

**Adam Hardy** (00:20:57): It's all downloadable, so, uh. Sidney could go through and download everything off the app. Can you access the app from the... You're talking about the resources. Yeah, the audio, video resources.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:21:11): The worst case scenario, we upload them.

**Adam Hardy** (00:21:13): We just get them up, and then I can quickly style them up to the rest of the site, as long as there's content.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:21:20): Damn, the biggest problem has been lack of content, and then their pages are just a mess to begin with. Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:21:32): So for a mobile app, I need to be able to say, like to a contractor, here are the pages that we are going to have, the screens. Here are the screens that we're going to have on the app.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:21:42): Here's the purpose of the app.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:21:44): And then here's a brand guideline, design guidelines that mimic the website.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:21:52): Yeah. Now with this developer that you have in mind, are you going to need Adam to do my ups of the pages, or is this guy going to be able to...

**Anthony Elliott** (00:22:00): I think if we have just the, as long as we have design guidelines, and the website, I can give the max to the website, you need to match the, match it. How do we feel from a layout and UX perspective, Adam, of just mimicking what they already have?

**Adam Hardy** (00:22:16): Yeah, I think it's fine. I mean, you could probably clean it up a little bit, but, yeah.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:22:23): So Mimic, Layout, and UX of the current app, follow these brand style guidelines, which Anthony, it's in Drive. Oh, okay.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:22:32): They have a good brand style guide.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:22:36): And these are the pages. Do we want to walk through, Adam, which pages?

**Adam Hardy** (00:22:44): That would go on the app?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:22:46): That would go on the app? Is that something we feel comfortable doing now?

**Adam Hardy** (00:22:50): In six minutes? Probably not.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:22:53): That's something you and Anthony could do in my apps.

**Adam Hardy** (00:22:58): I need to look at the app, and then I need to. Fill in these blanks here because I'm learning about all kinds of stuff they have resource-wise.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:23:10): You know, that would actually be helpful, Adam. If you could build out a spreadsheet or I could build a spreadsheet for you of one column of we can add this to the app, no problem, these pages. This is the extra stuff that we'd have to wait to do down the line because then I could tee Mike up. And basically say, hey, there are some things that you have on your current app that, one, are outside the scope of the agreement, and two, are more custom in nature. We can revisit those, but these are the things that we can try to get done by your end of February due date. Just to keep them in the loop, if that's something you'd be willing to do, Adam, take a half hour to wait. Thanks, listening. Thank Through the app and see what's custom and what's something we could definitely knock out right away.

**Adam Hardy** (00:24:05): Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:24:10): That'd be a big help.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:24:12): Yeah, because then that gives Anthony direction what to tell the contractor.

**Adam Hardy** (00:24:21): Yeah. Okay.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:24:26): And in terms of purpose of the app, did they say anything about that? It was.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:24:38): Let me see if I can ask Fathom if that came up at all.

**Adam Hardy** (00:24:45): It was Micah that was leading that discovery. He's very to the point of, like, he was more on the, this is what we can do, than clarifying questions. I don't think he got too far into. Yeah. Purpose and Goals.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:25:03): And Anthony, didn't Micah start working on something infrastructure-wise?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:25:07): That was C4i.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:25:09): Is there anything that's usable there?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:25:13): It's on the API side. So... Just pulling stuff?

**Adam Hardy** (00:25:19): Yes, but it's not...

**Anthony Elliott** (00:25:20): It'll speed up our development. But it's not something we would show a client.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:25:27): And according to Ask Fathom, based on the discussion, the main purposes of the Firefighters for Christ mobile app are to provide a mobile-optimized experience for accessing firefighters for Christ's content and resources, allow users to easily engage with the ministry through features like accessing the Bible and devotional content, connecting the Firefighters for Christ's social media channels, submitting prayer requests, or contacting the ministry, potentially managing our membership-slash-giving information. Which is a whole other thing.

**Adam Hardy** (00:26:00): All that is possible, minus the Bible.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:26:04): Serve as a companion to the main Firefighters for Christ website, the app and website providing a consistent, integrated experience.

**Adam Hardy** (00:26:13): Yeah.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:26:18): The app is seen as an important part of Firefighters for Christ's overall digital strategy, allowing them to better engage their audience and provide access to their resources in a mobile-friendly format.

**Adam Hardy** (00:26:28): I'll just have Cursor build it. Just don't worry about it, guys.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:26:31): That is what I'm saying.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:26:37): Like, gotta have someone to drive it out. Even if it's me driving it out, like, I need to be able to give it solid direction.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:26:45): Yep.

**Adam Hardy** (00:26:46): Yep.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:26:46): Which is why AI is not replacing our jobs yet, compared to what some people are saying.

**Adam Hardy** (00:26:53): Let's give it lots of recordings of other people talking about it, and be like, drive drive yourself, AI.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:27:03): No, I, if we had someone who could, we had a pattern laid for mobile apps, Mike has suggested a pattern, so if we had that pattern laid, I do think we could just turn cursor loose on it, and if we gave it the pattern, here's the pattern to follow, here's what the app should do, here's some brand guidelines. A simple app like this, I bet it could churn it out quickly.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:27:30): We're just not quite there yet.

**Adam Hardy** (00:27:32): Yep. It's a shame.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:27:37): Okay, so as far as action steps are concerned, Adam, you're going to document which pages on the app we can definitely do in a short period of time, which ones are going to be more custom in nature, since they're not on a website. And then Anthony, once you have that, you're going to reach out to the contractor about doing this and seeing if it's something we can get done. And by the end of February.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:28:01): Yeah. Okay.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:28:03): I will do that.

**Adam Hardy** (00:28:05): I think that we'd have another thing we'd have a problem with is events because we're not using like an event collection. Maybe that moves us more into the events plugin.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:28:20): They don't have an event calendar.

**Adam Hardy** (00:28:24): Well, we were just because of the nature of the calendar and how it's just a calendar. We went away from that, but I could go back that way for the app's sake. Does that make sense? Easy enough. Easy peasy.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:28:48): You want to stay on a minute? know, Mike, you got to drop, but I can stay on with Adam to talk on events a bit more.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:28:54): Yeah. Do you guys want me to set up tasks for you on those two things?

**Adam Hardy** (00:28:57): Yes, please.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:29:00): Unless Kaczor can handle that for us. I'll just set up tasks.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:29:07): Thanks, Mike.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:29:08): Yeah, and then just let me know if we could get this, like, both of those things done by the end of this week, since we're just pushing up against time, really. And I told Mike I'd reach out to him tomorrow to let him know. So I'll basically give him the plan that Adam's reviewing the app, there might be some things, there are going to be some things that we can't get in in that time frame. And it's actually out of scope of the agreement. I'll figure out how to wordsmith it. And then our lead, our lead, Deb, is going to talk to a contractor about resourcing, which will speed it up. I just want him to see that we're actually trying to speed it up for on his behalf. So I still won't commit to that end of February, but I'll keep him on the hook at least.

**Adam Hardy** (00:29:56): Why are they ditching sub? Subsplash? Because it expires.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:30:01): I think they've got like an annual thing.

**Adam Hardy** (00:30:04): Can they switch to month to month? That's not how it works.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:30:08): So this was a question that I was going to ask, and it would be odd for us to offer this, but since we are delayed and it's not all his fault, if they switch month to month, could we absorb the cost? Because it might be cheaper, to be honest with you, for us to absorb their subsplash. Expense, than to try to speed this up, you know what I mean? Yeah.

**Adam Hardy** (00:30:42): It doesn't really make sense to me to just ditch it completely, if you have the option to go month to month.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:30:51): Let me see what I already said.

**Adam Hardy** (00:30:53): expenses get a lot more with a month to month. Contract with them, I don't know. I don't know anything about What about SubSplash? Never been on my radar.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:31:05): Yeah, it just says that a SubSplash account renews on January 15th.

**Adam Hardy** (00:31:10): I'm looking at pricing. Does it have any pricing exposed?

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:31:17): And if we did that, if we did that, what would happen when we make MIP Live? Would that still make his website defunct, or the app, if SubSplash isn't the live one?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:31:37): No, we would keep their app up, as long as they've paid for SubSplash, their app would stay.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:31:46): Even if their domain is pointing to MIP?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:31:54): That'd be good to confirm, but I would assume so, because it doesn't look like it's tied in. We might need Modify some DNS records for them, but that's fine.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:32:06): So is that something that you guys want me to ask?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:32:15): I would at least explore that, yeah. I mean, if we can tack on, it expires January 15th, so if we can take a tack on even one more month, that's at least becoming possible. That bumps up right at the NRB, and then two more months should be fine. It's probably in the order of $500 a month. I have that number in my head from something.

**Adam Hardy** (00:32:46): There's also a possibility they just don't do monthly. You would think they'd have to.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:32:54): He seemed to indicate it was annual.

**Adam Hardy** (00:32:58): Well, yeah, you usually have an option to do. And that's usually, they'd get you into that by saving.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:33:03): But if they told SubSplash, hey, we're canceling, like, we're going to cancel it, but if you can keep on, keep us on for another month or two, we would do that. SubSplash should jump at that.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:33:16): Yeah. Okay. I'll throw that out there and see if I'm on play option. I won't offer to absorb that yet, but I'll ask them if there's an option to switch to month, wait for SubSplash, so that their app doesn't go down.

**Adam Hardy** (00:33:35): Could start as high as $100 per month.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:33:41): That's a no-brainer, to be honest It could be more than that.

**Adam Hardy** (00:33:44): That's just AI telling me, possibly. Because it's not exposed without going down a rabbit hole.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:33:52): Yeah. All right. I could explore that. That would be a creative way to cover ourselves. A bit, and I think, I don't know how we would do that. That would be annoying. Well, we could credit their first, their several, for several monthly licenses. I don't know what it turns out to. I don't, I don't, this is so messy.

**Adam Hardy** (00:34:23): I don't understand, like, you just.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:34:27): Yeah, that's, that's the hard part. It's, it's like, is this, do you really need it? Do you really need to shut down SubSplash? What it sounds like is they pay an annual amount. They've always paid an annual amount. They don't want to pay the annual amount again. And so the easiest thing is just to cut it clean. What I'm irritated about is that they did not, this is the first time, last week was the first time I heard that, was that they were cutting it off on January 15th. If I knew that three months ago, things would have been different. If we do one of these again...

**Adam Hardy** (00:35:00): also, I think you have to have a good idea of the website and the app and how they're to be built out at the same time. So the work is, we're not hurting ourself on the, you know, something we do with the website on the app side, right? They're working more in unison so that once the website's done, the app has everything it needs. That makes sense. Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:35:28): Yeah.

**Adam Hardy** (00:35:29): I think this time we kind of did like, we'll just do the website and then that, we'll just, the app will work from the website.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:35:36): Yeah. No, maybe it will, maybe it won't. I don't like these custom projects.

**Adam Hardy** (00:35:42): Yeah, especially stuff that we haven't done before, right?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:35:45): Yeah.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:35:45): And I have had conversations ad nauseum about this and certain people, unless they're in the work, don't get that. What it does to us from a production standpoint.

**Adam Hardy** (00:35:59): No. No.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:36:01): So we're going to muscle through it. And that's the hard part. It's like, regardless how I feel about it, it is what it is, and we still have to do it and figure it out. It's just complicated and annoying.

**Adam Hardy** (00:36:12): Not worried about getting done. just feature if we do it again.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:36:17): Yep, yep, yep. All right, I'm going to jump. Are you guys staying on?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:36:23): Let's stay on briefly, Adam, to talk about the events. I want to understand what you're saying better.

**Mike Kaczorowski** (00:36:28): I'm going to make you close to Anthony.

**Adam Hardy** (00:36:30): So, let me pull up my screen. It's very loud and barking. Oh, it's just, you know. You're okay. Oh, you're very sad about this app as well.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:36:52): Oh, no fact.

**Adam Hardy** (00:37:11): I'm going to get into the events. All right. I'm going to share those. So here, these are just blocks, right? And we're not using the event. Okay.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:37:34): We could very easily.

**Adam Hardy** (00:37:37): Oh, I'm not logged in. Let's. Very easily come in here and do a nice little calendar. And recreate it. And whether we just have, you know, just this, replace the events page with the event calendar, or if we have this just running the app, I don't know. That'd be something to decide. But I'm going to guess this, the app needs something like this.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:38:20): It would be more for, know, what would other websites use? That's the main question.

**Adam Hardy** (00:38:28): I want to do something that we can reuse for another site. Based off of this, like, it does seem like they have enough events that maybe we should do an event calendar, but when I go to their website, the events are buried. So I'm trying to pull them out on the homepage, too, which right now we don't have a component to pull events in anywhere, right? So they would just have to read, just have to have this link to the calendar page. But... That's not a big deal.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:39:05): What does the event calendar, can you show a different site that does have the event calendar? Is that built out enough to look nice?

**Adam Hardy** (00:39:13): What is that, the... I don't know what it's called. The Armandcast? Oh, yeah, here. Hang on. Oh. My skills today on... Copy the right... Oh. I didn't know what you had last time. So... I don't even know. Whatever Calendar is. More classes, maybe. No. Calendar. So very boring, like Google.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:40:14): Yeah.

**Adam Hardy** (00:40:15): Calendar, but it does have a nice kind of event pages. can add to Calendar, which would be all stuff that you'd want to be able to do from the app. So that's how. And it has time, you know, it has the time information in probably a uniform way that can be pulled into the app.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:40:35): Yeah, having the structure will make it a lot better for the app.

**Adam Hardy** (00:40:40): So no matter what, we'll create the calendar and then we'll just decide with them whether we want to have that face on the website as well. But I would assume so. Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:40:52): Okay. So we will use the Events Calendar for the mobile app.

**Adam Hardy** (00:40:57): Mm-hmm. So that solves that. And if we can have Sydney start working on those collections, we could have those. And then I think I just looked at the site. It's structured pretty well for a mobile app, actually, when I'm looking at it. Now, whether we'd have all the pages I need to go through, but looking at your about, your chapters, resources, and get involved in store, those all seem like appropriate web app navigation, too. And then those, like, important, you know, I mean, we get rid of Become a Member, but we have prayer requests, chaplain requests, and donate at the bottom.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:41:37): What does prayer, what do those do right now on the website?

**Adam Hardy** (00:41:41): Those two, a prayer request form on another page, which I need to hook up still, but I think, what do we end up putting that? That's something that had me move, like, six times. I think it's on resources now. I don't think I've moved the form yet, that's the problem. There, it's right here at the bottom. So it's not a separate page, but I didn't want it a separate page.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:42:12): Okay, but it's just a form, a form on MIP.

**Adam Hardy** (00:42:18): Pretty simple form.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:42:21): Prayer form. They have become a member, but we can cut that, it could cut that out. Donate.

**Adam Hardy** (00:42:36): Donate. form? I think that's working, it's going to go to an external donation page, maybe.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:42:43): And we could have that in the app, but it would just link out, it'll open up a browser.

**Adam Hardy** (00:42:48): And then Chaplain request as a form.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:42:52): Okay. then...

**Adam Hardy** (00:42:58): Kind of everything blew up. It's just information about becoming a chaplain, but it also gives you a place to request. And then there are resources, which are just PDFs.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:43:33): Ooh.

**Adam Hardy** (00:43:36): Still need to styled.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:43:42): Ooh. Here's the donation page. Okay.

**Adam Hardy** (00:43:50): Externally. Although we were going to look at that with them, it may be like embedded form at some point, which would be the same for the app, I guess. It would really matter. Just be next to a link or an internal link.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:44:05): Yeah. So some forms have the prayer form, have the donate, which would open up a browser, and have the chaplain request form, have an event calendar, video and audio collections.

**Adam Hardy** (00:44:22): Fine chapters, but they're not, again, we didn't do custom. would have done these in this collection if I would have known. You know, that there might be some kind of use in the app. So right now, just the individual areas are subpages. This isn't done, though, yet.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:44:41): So are you seeing, like, a, yeah, chapters would be a button in the app that you can click on and see all of them?

**Adam Hardy** (00:44:50): And then you'd have your about, and you'd have your subpages under about. Some of it may not be needed, like. message. fiction. I don't know that you need partnerships.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:45:06): Okay.

**Adam Hardy** (00:45:08): For a story you probably maybe don't even need, probably just need what we believe, mission and value, maybe FAQ and contact us.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:45:19): And what else is on the top? So about chapters, resources, can you go to resources?

**Adam Hardy** (00:45:24): So this is the one that's kind of probably going be the most important for that. So this is an external link. This is an external link. This is an external link. This is a link that goes to that spot on the page. Okay.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:45:40): What's the daily verse?

**Adam Hardy** (00:45:42): It just needs deleted. That was something I was playing around with.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:45:45): Okay.

**Adam Hardy** (00:45:46): And obviously you wouldn't have the mobile app page.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:45:48): Right. So the only thing on there is external links and the media ministry. on In... go Of Thank

**Adam Hardy** (00:46:02): Which is all of those, it's just goes to external places too.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:46:13): Okay.

**Adam Hardy** (00:46:15): There is, there are resources somewhere, so this is the problem with our site. I suggest that goes out internally. Chapter resources, that's where this, that's where a lot of the. resources, Thank So app resources. So that gets a little bit confusing. Probably should think about that on exposing that in here as well.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:47:15): What do they have in there on the chapter resources?

**Adam Hardy** (00:47:17): It's so slow. All of like the resources they recommend.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:47:24): Okay.

**Adam Hardy** (00:47:25): So it's a long list, but I've just found out they organized it really nicely in here. So I'm going to have to go back through. Because they didn't provide us with all that information, and I wasn't going to be able to go through and organize 30 resources into a nice, neat topic. Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:47:49): Okay.

**Adam Hardy** (00:47:51): And then if we get those collections put together and put those under resources. we're to go I'm go Finally, so you can see all the ones.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:48:15): Okay.

**Adam Hardy** (00:48:17): It would just be individual pages once they're connected, but.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:48:25): Asked a different way, because I just need more time to sit down with this, but. What if I had the mobile app? What if I gave it like the. The core structure. And then literally pulled all the pages from the website. The app would need to show them different, but it's going to be the exact same content that's on every page on the website and make a screen for that. Because I'm not seeing anything that would be like, oh, that would be bad to have. Yeah.

**Adam Hardy** (00:48:59): Yeah. Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:49:00): The mobile app page, but it's like, okay, if that show is not a big deal. Oh, so you're saying expose it all?

**Adam Hardy** (00:49:08): Yeah, that'd be fine. There's probably some stuff that doesn't need to be, but like you said, I probably wouldn't make or break.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:49:17): And maybe I have a filter.

**Adam Hardy** (00:49:20): I would present, I'd probably have a new homepage that's more concise, right?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:49:25): Yeah. It's more targeted to new members.

**Adam Hardy** (00:49:30): Where I would probably get them right into resources and events and. So that would be different, I would think. Outside of that, it could all be structured the exact same way. And just give them a new pathway on the mobile app into these areas.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:49:50): Yeah. Okay. What about the language thing? We can only do English on the mobile app.

**Adam Hardy** (00:50:11): Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:50:21): For the price they paid, that's all we should do.

**Adam Hardy** (00:50:29): And I don't see that, mean, currently they don't have the option, I don't see.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:50:36): That's a bit different with the app, because with an app, if you, well, yeah, there are some really nice apps that let you switch your language, but typically I feel like you'd have a separate app. They could have a separate app for the Spanish. Okay. Okay. So we need to have a custom homepage, get them into resources and events quickly. Otherwise, we could pull all the pages from the website and put them in the app, maybe exclude some. Okay, I kind of might try going that route.

**Adam Hardy** (00:51:27): Yep, I think that would work. then you just have your, would you have, still have your app home buttons, you know? That one, they have home Bible, blue letter Bible. You could still have, because that's an external.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:51:45): Yeah, what would you want for those buttons?

**Adam Hardy** (00:51:48): I would not have, I don't think I'd have home. I'd have resources. Well, I'd try to emulate this type, so maybe prayer. Requests, Resources, Connect and Donate, or Give, whatever.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:52:08): Okay, I should be... I'll put some more time behind that, though.

**Adam Hardy** (00:52:11): That's just off the top of my head. So I will get you over... I know we're doing this right now, but I will also get you over my final thoughts on...

**Anthony Elliott** (00:52:19): Okay, that'd be helpful. Wait, I initially think... Regardless of...

**Adam Hardy** (00:52:23): The would be Prayer Resources. So if everything goes over, I'll just point out anything that's missing that's currently on the app, and then I will save... These are pages that definitely have to be on the app that are on the website.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:52:37): Yeah.

**Adam Hardy** (00:52:39): And then I will home... Kind of the home key buttons, bottom.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:52:47): Okay.

**Adam Hardy** (00:52:48): Should be on the home page itself. Would that help?

**Anthony Elliott** (00:52:52): Yeah, that'd be great.

**Adam Hardy** (00:52:57): I can't even throw that out. Figma Claude and see if they could mock up a home wireframe.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:53:06): Yeah, Figma can do that better.

**Adam Hardy** (00:53:16): You have something to show a contractor.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:53:21): Yeah. That's what I had the last time. started talking to the contractor, they're like, well, so what do you think about design? Like, well, we'll get there. What pages are on the app? Can you help us figure that out?

**Adam Hardy** (00:53:38): Yeah. Yep. Messy.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:53:43): Yep.

**Adam Hardy** (00:53:44): But I like solving problems, so let's solve it and get it out the door. Ship it.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:53:50): Thanks for diving into this with me, Adam. Much appreciated.

**Adam Hardy** (00:53:53): Oh, yeah.

**Anthony Elliott** (00:53:55): Okay, I'll let you go. I'll see you.

**Adam Hardy** (00:53:57): Yep. Bye.
