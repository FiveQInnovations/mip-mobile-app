Good morning, Adam.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Double booked.

There we go.

I'm trying to get into my ear there, Mike, but I'm on the speaker, and I'm trying not to disrupt somebody here.

Yeah, no problem.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

be right Okay.

Yeah, nothing.

You just let us know when you're ready to roll.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, I'm going to relocate.

Okay, Joe.

I mean, Mike, we're good.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Awesome.

How's it going?

Good.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Got a big go live.

You know that world.

I've a big go-live at my workplace today, so just kind of monitoring that.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Yep, we understand that.

Yep.

**Michael's iPhone:**

That's for sure.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

You're leaving for your trip here in a couple days, right, on Thursday?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Thursday, yeah.

Yeah, I'm trying to just finalize that itinerary, too.

So anyway, yeah, we're good.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Excellent, excellent.

I know Hannah's not going to be able to make it.

did include her on the invite so that she could get the recording of the video.

So anyone from Robert, is he going to be joining us?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, I did not hear from Robert.

Okay.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

We can go ahead and dive in.

**Michael's iPhone:**

I don't know, Mike, if you've ever actually met Anthony before.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Anthony, have you ever met Mike, maybe in passing?

**Anthony Elliott:**

Might have been about a year ago.

Yeah, it's been a while.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Oh, I remember Anthony.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, I recognize you from when we first connected back in whenever that was.

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Awesome.

You said you'd be back.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Here you are.

Yeah, is.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Yeah, so...

Just for your information, Anthony is going to be the developer working and has been working on your app.

And so today we really want to just kind of review where we're at right now and get feedback and keep pushing forward those efforts.

And then while we're here, I know that you had posted about four comments in Pastel.

Thank you for getting in there and using that tool regarding the website.

I haven't seen anything from Robert or Hannah coming through yet, but there might have been just some outstanding questions that we want to make sure that we're on the same page on and what to expect.

And I'd love to just touch base on those to keep the ball moving on the website side of things.

So any questions about kind of what I'm hoping to cover for today?

**Michael's iPhone:**

No, on the website, you know, my plan is to, you know, spend some ample time in it in the next, you know, before I leave to give you, I'll probably load you up with a bunch of stuff.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

No, that's okay.

That's what we want.

**Michael's iPhone:**

I'll have connectivity where I'm at, and I'll be able to check it.

know, the hours will just be way off, you know what mean?

Sure, sure.

You know, so that— Yeah, anyway.

That was one question I was curious about, Mike, with you being gone.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

I know originally we had said, hey, let's get feedback by the 20th, which I think is still fine.

As far as a launch date, knowing that we're going to be obviously making updates based on your feedback, originally we were saying, hey, let's go ahead and shoot for a launch date of the 26th to the 28th.

With you being gone, do you want to extend that estimated launch date out just to make sure that we're not rushed and you're not reviewing feedback?

Because what's going to happen is you're going to provide feedback, we're going to implement the feedback, and we're still going to want you to get in and get an eye on it just to make sure that it looks exactly how you wanted it to look.

And so with you being on your trip, we're fine to still shoot for those dates, but just logistically, I want to make sure you're taken care of.

**Michael's iPhone:**

No, I like the idea of, I mean, if it's okay with you, I don't mind pushing it

Maybe a week, you know, into the next week, that would give me, like you said, time to, you know, get back and dig back into it and make sure we're all good.

Yeah, that's fine with us, too.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

So I would say still try to get all the feedback in by the 20th if you can, and then we'll be working on it while you're away.

Remind me, is this business or is it a vacation that you're going on?

**Michael's iPhone:**

No, it's ministry.

It's Firefighters to Christ doing one of our training trips.

Matter of fact, we'll probably end up with some new pictures to throw up on your website, you know.

But anyway, yeah, that's what this is.

All right.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Well, we don't need to spend any more time on that, but Anthony, I would pass it off over to you.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

Thanks.

Mike, see you're on a phone.

If I share my screen, that probably won't show up the best.

Yeah, I'll do my best.

**Michael's iPhone:**

I'm at my work, so I'm not able to.

Yeah, I'm using the work computer today, so yeah, I'm really close to the screen, you notice that?

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, I sent over a recording, but I didn't send it over until just this morning.

Is there any chance you watched that?

No, I did not watch it.

Okay, I will run through it, but stop me, because I don't know, maybe I can share on my different screen here, it's a little smaller.

**Michael's iPhone:**

The first one you sent over, Anthony, I watched it, and I don't know if it was preset to the, you know, one and a half times the speed of your voice, and I'm like, this guy's really fast.

Well, that's good.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Most people hear my normal voice and think, oh, that guy's a slow talker.

Yeah, I figured it out.

I'm reorganizing my windows here, so bear with me.

Thank you.

.

Okay, I don't usually share from this screen, so we'll see how it goes.

Okay, can you see my, an app?

Yeah.

I'll let you adjust that here in a second.

So, made some overall, I focused on the homepage this time.

Last time was really getting the, the function of this, of the whole app, like, the basic functionality in there.

And then, today, I'll be showing the homepage and making the design better, more improved on here.

Yeah.

This is the first pass on that.

Also, these things are, most of what you see on the homepage is changeable from the website.

I, I'll, I'll show you a little bit of that, but I might just leave that for you to see in the, in the, we, I can cover it and you can see it in the recording.

It's going to be hard to see on your phone.

So yeah, it's not that hard.

**Michael's iPhone:**

I almost have it.

It almost looks like it's on my phone.

**Anthony Elliott:**

You know what mean?

**Michael's iPhone:**

By looking at it this way.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Okay.

Yeah.

We're all right.

Okay.

So yeah, first, you had called out the kind of the duplicated headers, but having a title on there multiple times, firefighters for Christ.

Yeah.

How does this look here?

We've got the kind of the big logo, and then I don't duplicate the logo.

Don't duplicate the title at all.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

I noticed that right away.

That's better.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

Yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Great.

**Anthony Elliott:**

So implemented the header.

I did implement the small header up here where it says FFC, and then a search bar.

So that's going to stay across all the pages.

And this, the large logo will only stay on the homepage.

That way we can use that screen real estate for content.

Okay.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Okay.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Now, next is the cards here.

This, this,

It looked pretty basic before, so I can scroll up on here, so the cars here, I was calling them Quick Tasks.

Adam, if you have a better name, you're good with information architecture.

you think of a better name, I'm all for that.

So you can scroll over here.

These were links, Mike, taken from the existing app.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

And so you got an About, What We Believe, Peace to God.

I did add Facebook and Instagram in here.

These are easily changeable from the website.

Okay.

So you'll be able to, we can launch for something, and you guys can change it after.

And out of this featured section here, which is a, I picked a couple, but you can add more, and you can change these from the website as well.

So, Chaplain Resources, a daily Bible verse and search, a store.

...

...

...

...

Now, I'm going to click in here.

I haven't – when the page opens, it needs a little bit of love.

I focused on the homepage this time, not on the content pages.

So I'm going to click on the chaplain pages, chaplain resources.

So it loads.

You can see the content.

You can see the image.

All this is coming from your website.

So if you change this page on your website, it'll change here on people's phones.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Okay.

So those featured spots are just – and by the way, this is all managed off the website, the back end of the website, right?

**Anthony Elliott:**

That's right.

Yes.

**Michael's iPhone:**

The app will be managed in the same window, back end that we log into for the website.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Let me drag that over so you can see that here.

Okay.

I'm showing the back end of the website here.

So here – Yeah.

And so you can see the pages.

There's now –

Oh, I don't know if this was there before, but there's now a tab called Mobile Settings.

I would not edit this stuff yet until I hand off the mobile app to you, but it's there.

So this section here for Quick Task, this has the About FFC, Peace with God.

It's looking a little small here on my small screen, but this is all editable.

So if I want to say I had this as About Us earlier, so if I change this back to About Us and hit Save, and then come back to my simulator, now note it hasn't changed here yet, but I, if I close the app and reopen it, now it says About Us.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Okay.

**Anthony Elliott:**

So that just, that's real, it'll be really easy for you guys to manage.

You can, you can change text, you can add new ones on here, either to this Quick Task section here, comments, or what's

Or to the Featured section here down below.

Even like this, I just put the store in as an example, but you can change the badge on here.

So here, this one says new.

can.

Here's a store.

can you can change with instead of saying new.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Clearance sale.

Yeah, there you go.

Sale.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Let me go back to my simulator again.

have to kill it and let it load again.

Now you can see the store here says sale in that badge.

It's real, real easy for you guys to manage and edit there.

**Michael's iPhone:**

I wanted to replace, let's just say the daily verse and Bible search with, you know, now you were calling these tabs or cards, I think you called them.

If we wanted wanted to put a.

Different, like, say, events or something like that, I can do that, right?

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yep.

Just put that in there, right?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

So you would come in here, you would add a new one, you select which page it's going to feature, and add in.

The image is important, so you want to make sure you find a good image for that.

But yeah, everything is, you can enter everything in here, and then it'll appear on your app once you kill your app and reload it.

**Michael's iPhone:**

So from an app, you know, just, you're an expert on apps, so...

You know, looking at an app and how an app is used, I mean, I've been on travel, I'm trying to, you know, deal with my flight on Philippine Airlines today, and I'm on their app.

I notice, you know, I'm used to scrolling up or down on the page that I'm on in the app.

If I click something else, it's going to take me to a different page.

How, I mean, I like how you've set this up.

I think our current one, everything is on there.

You've to scroll.

How would I find stuff that's not on the homepage?

**Anthony Elliott:**

You know what mean?

**Michael's iPhone:**

What gives me some navigation to whatever else is available?

**Anthony Elliott:**

So we've got a couple ways here.

So one is, let's go into the About page.

You can see it here.

Let's say I want to find a local chapter.

Adam, I might need some design hints here too, but I need to make these, make it more noticeable that this is a page that you can click on.

Yeah.

So you can go to that, and now it loaded up that page.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

So that's one way.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Also, we've got the tab bar here at the bottom.

So on the homepage, you can go to the Resources tab.

I got you.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Okay.

**Anthony Elliott:**

And you can, like here's the, it's not as obvious on here, but the Media Ministry is a tappable page that you can go into, and then see from there, keep on tapping through, and you can go back.

So we got the chapters tab, about again, and I put a get involved in there.

This is getting cut off, so I'll need to, probably, we probably should reduce that down to four.

So that's the tab bar, and you can click in on the pages.

Also, there's a search now.

added this since the last video that you saw.

So you can search for, say, Bible, and results appear here, and you can click in from that.

So your whole website really is available in here, too, in an easy fashion for the people to find.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, okay.

Yeah, I think as far as the homepage goes, and the other thing that's interesting, how you have those cards set up to scroll left to right.

Not sure I'm used to seeing that on an app where you do that, but I have to look at some other apps and see how that plays out.

**Adam Hardy:**

I would put kind of computer there, Anthony.

That you can scroll.

I know you've got a card through, but maybe some kind of other indicator.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Well, yeah, plus the way it looks, I mean, you've got the About Us, and then you've got half of the other one, which indicates that there's something there, and you can scroll, but it just looks a little awkward.

I would almost think that the About Us card would be the same size of whatever the featured card is below that, and maybe you have some sort of arrow that would indicate you can scroll.

I don't know, just looks, it doesn't look polished with, you know, half of the next card kind of showing up on the screen there, you know, on your homepage, if that makes sense.

I don't know.

yep.

**Anthony Elliott:**

No, that's good.

And I am, I'm going to lean on Adam here too.

I'll get some input from you, Adam, on how to make that look nicer.

**Adam Hardy:**

Some thoughts around, is this going to, this is going be predominantly used by members, right, of, of the organization.

So there's probably not going to be a ton of people downloading the app from outside.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Is that correct?

Yeah, mean, we have a lot of, I mean, our, what we really, we promote the app, everywhere we go.

Okay.

And so we do want people to know it's there, because that's, you know, they're, they're probably not going to find it on their desktop, you know, mean, it, you know, we go to conventions, and we're at events and activities, and we always have the QR code on our.

You know, on our business card, it's on our bookmark that we give away.

We have several ways for people to find the app.

And we try to drive people to the app.

So, yeah, I would say we want it to be really prominent, you know, with respect to just general folks.

I mean, they're not going to find it just by looking for it.

We're going to have to tell them it's there.

**Adam Hardy:**

I'm thinking more for what content's actually being kind of promoted on the app.

Should it be more?

**Michael's iPhone:**

yeah, and the things that we have on our website that are like permanently on the, like you've done on the top where, you know, prayer request, you know, become a member, find a chaplain, you know, request a chaplain.

And services, we want people to be able to use this to get to us, you know, primarily, and then also see, you know, what the content is as far as resources.

And, you know, if...

Events and, you know, stuff like that.

Our social media pages, I like how he's got them easy to find.

I like the fact that maybe there's just icons, you know, that they know, right, you know, somehow those are, yeah, because that's how people are going to find us and learn more about us.

I don't really, like, you know, like I we can change what's in the featured section or just have some anchored cards there that kind of drive people to the other spots on the web or in the app.

But, yeah, we want to have people be able to get the prayer request in just by seeing it right there.

You know, maybe they got to scroll a little bit or it's near the top there, you know, and it's, yeah, anyway.

Yeah, just being able to get a prayer request.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have them in here.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, we have a, we have a prayer request form for that, that, you know, it's pretty much on every page.

**Michael's iPhone:**

If you go on our website, no matter what.

If page you're on, you're going to see that.

**Adam Hardy:**

And I kind of like that idea.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Let me see.

The other thing people go to the app for a lot, we've noticed, because when we have the, with Subsplash, the only thing we have any feedback on is the app.

We have no feedback on the website.

And the app, the thing people do most on the app is actually go to the media resources and, you know, listen to a sermon or something.

That's the thing that happens most on the app.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Oh, right.

I'm not showing their existing app.

Yeah.

Do you have them on the website?

**Adam Hardy:**

Yeah, we didn't see those on the actual website.

**Michael's iPhone:**

No, there, there's, there's, you're right.

There's, I mean, there's the.

Links there, you know, to the media page, and there's a monthly thing they put out that you guys have, I think you've given us, you've put that on the page.

So, but there's, we also store them, you know, in the back end so that people, not all of them, I think there's, I'd have to look on the app now, how many are in there.

It's interesting because we can tell how many, you know, of which one they're downloading and listening to.

There are some that are pretty popular.

**Adam Hardy:**

We'll need a page on the website to house that if we're going to make those visible on the app, too.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Okay.

**Adam Hardy:**

Now that the app and the website aren't separate entities, we'll just need to make sure that we cover around anything that you want that's only on the app now, we'll have to also make a page.

Whether it's visible on the website, that's one thing, but it'll at least have to exist on the website.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Okay, all right, it's good to know, because I'm not that familiar, I've gone in there.

All

A times, but I do think there's things like that, like the fact that there's those, you know, MP3 files for, I'm going to say, about a dozen messages or so that are kind of the favorites, you know, of people.

**Adam Hardy:**

What I'll do is I'll create a collection for those audio files that we can then utilize in the app, too.

And then we can talk about whether you want to expose that on the website itself or just in the app.

**Michael's iPhone:**

yeah, and then going forward, we can, like you've said before, we can add or, you know, take, add a couple more, take a couple off, kind of keep it, keep those in there.

They can go to the media website and look for anything they want, but I've noticed with the app, if they're there and easy to get to, people tend to grab them and listen to them, you know.

It makes sense.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, we find that users tend to engage longer on a mobile app than they do on the website.

Yeah, yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

And again, those...

Those, currently, those, I don't believe those recordings are even on our website.

**Adam Hardy:**

Yeah, they're not.

Yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

We can have them just in the app.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Are they on any website that you guys have access to, like this firefighter.org?

Yeah, they're there.

**Michael's iPhone:**

That's where they're located, and I believe we can download them from there.

But, you know, currently with Subsplash, I think we have them embedded as files in the, you know, whatever system they have.

I could, I could probably, you know, get those to you or, you know, or at least give you what the titles are.

I will figure that out.

You just tell me what you need to get the ones up that.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, so, and I apologize for my context.

So firefighters.org, you guys own that as well?

No, we don't.

**Michael's iPhone:**

It's a unique relationship.

That's a completely separate entity using the same name.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

You know, it started.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Way back when as a joint venture, and it's kind of split into two different things, but we still work together, they use, they retain our old logo and the name Firefighters for Christ, just because that's the way it's always, but yeah, we have to get it, we have to get the files off their site or, you know, from them.

**Anthony Elliott:**

And they have a lot of files, so just whatever's in the app right now is what you would want.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like I said, I, let me tell you, I can, I can go to the app real quick, let me open it, just to give you an idea.

Yeah, if you could send us the files that you want in the app.

That's what I thought we would do.

**Adam Hardy:**

Then I'll create a collection that Anthony can utilize in the app.

**Michael's iPhone:**

There's like 10 categories, and then there's like, you know, four, five, you know, you know, four or five or six, so there might be.

Maybe up to 30 or 40 actual files, you know, and I don't know that these are links, but I think they're, they could be links, but I think they're the actual file.

I'd have to look, because you can download it right off the app, too.

**Adam Hardy:**

Oh, yeah.

Or you can just listen to it.

Yeah, I can download.

**Anthony Elliott:**

So, Adam, maybe we could get one or two, one or two of these and start the collection, and then, Mike, you can send us a full, all the files that you want us to feature, and once that's in, we can add that to the collection.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, sorry about that, Adam.

didn't realize that had to be a website versus, you know, something on the app alone.

**Adam Hardy:**

I think we knew that once we had looked in a little bit further.

We just wanted to get some information around that, so that's good.

And I'm

**Michael's iPhone:**

I'll go on our Subsplash site and look at the metrics on these particular messages, and we may not put them all back on there, but the ones that seem to be really popular, we'll probably put them in there.

**Adam Hardy:**

Do you have one offhand, Mike, that we could?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, the one that's most popular, believe it or not, and it's right there, the most popular one, for whatever reason, it's called Motorhome Adventure.

by David Gibbs.

**Adam Hardy:**

Interesting.

**Michael's iPhone:**

It's got to be 20 years old, and I tell you, people absolutely love that sermon.

It's under the Encouragement tab, as far as the categories within the current app.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Okay.

**Adam Hardy:**

Maybe it's not from this, then.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Is it a, yeah.

Yeah.

You said, speakers was, uh...

**Anthony Elliott:**

David Hibbs?

Gibbs with a G.

**Michael's iPhone:**

G.

And you know what?

You know, what's interesting about that?

We used to do, all of these were on CDs, right?

And, well, they all started on cassette tapes.

Not all of them, but a lot of them.

And then they started producing, they, the media ministry put them all on CDs.

And we would just have stacks of CDs on our tables when we went to these conventions.

People just walked away with dozens of them, you know?

And we hear, we get more feedback on this stuff than we do anything else.

Man, you know.

Sorry.

You know, so I don't know if it was a CD that we upload.

I don't know.

Is it in there?

That's great.

Is it in your inventory?

Are you looking at it?

**Anthony Elliott:**

It not.

I could not search for it by the title.

It's It's probably a file on Subsplash, and I'm going to have to send you.

Yeah.

Is what's going to happen.

Can I pull a different one from David?

You can pull any one.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, there's another one there called Doing the Impossible, which may, you know, might be there.

I don't know.

I don't see that one either.

**Anthony Elliott:**

But God's Power Tools?

that one?

Yeah, just pull any, yeah, anything would be fine.

Okay.

Yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Just to give you something to play with.

Yep.

**Adam Hardy:**

Hey.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Adam, are you going say something?

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, is there any, when you click on, can you click on the individual?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, there's not any more information, all right.

Yeah.

You too.

What?

**Anthony Elliott:**

Can I click on it from here?

No, I can't.

**Adam Hardy:**

What happens?

No.

Okay.

I was just seeing if there's any other data or script.

Can you dab him?

Can you download one off our app and then just upload it on your site?

Maybe.

I got this God's Power Tools one.

**Anthony Elliott:**

We can use that as a start.

**Michael's iPhone:**

All right.

Perfect.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, so there is probably going to be a good number that we just can't get on the website ourselves, and we'll have to wait for you guys to send that.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

Like I said, I'll take a look when I have a minute to see what kind of the ones that seem to still be getting the most hits.

And just probably focus on those.

Thank you.

**Adam Hardy:**

Anthony, will they be able to use a collection page as a featured item if they wanted to?

So would they ever be able to feature?

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

So we could feature the audio messages.

Yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, I think if we, because we get those monthly, and if we can update that, they send that out to us.

And then we post it on, you know, our website or our website.

post then post post post

Most social media stuff, so it'd be good if it was...

**Adam Hardy:**

You can have like a monthly message on there if you want it in the featured section.

Yeah, we can either pull one off and make that the feature, but they usually send us like six a month that are kind of the featured ones for the month.

Okay.

And, yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

I did want to talk to a couple limitations of the app.

So we, as we have it, you know, the app is pulling content from the website.

So the website is the source of truth, and the app will show that.

So we already talked through that.

Like we need to add the files to the website.

Something else that's similar are things like forms.

Yeah.

What I...

Where did it go?

I was trying to find it.

I must have taken it off while working on the homepage.

But on the...

If forms are forms for security reasons, there are security protections in the form.

And so...

We have those on the website.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

When you can, in the app, you'll still be able to have a request and tap on that, but it'll actually open up a browser right to that form.

So they don't have to scroll to see it.

They'll see the form.

They'll be able to fill out the form, but it would open up a browser right there.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Okay.

So that's a separate, it'll pop up a different, their website will open up basically, right?

Is that what will happen?

**Anthony Elliott:**

And then to get back to the app, they'll have to kind of make, manage their way back to the app.

It, as an example, so this is a Bible gateway.

So this is opening up in a, in the browser, and then you get this little, the little back, but on iOS, you get this back button here.

They can tap that.

Android, it's even easier to go right back.

Oh, nice.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Okay.

So that's pretty slick.

**Anthony Elliott:**

But just calling out, that's a...

That helps us keep the cost of this down.

In the future, we could add more custom forms in the app, but that would be a custom add-on.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

Yeah, we'll see how it plays.

I mean, the prayer would be the most important one.

**Anthony Elliott:**

And if that's something we might want to play with later, we'd be open to that just because we want that to be as simple as possible for everybody.

**Michael's iPhone:**

The other one would be the giving form, which is a link.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, and that one will be able to feature the giving.

Once that's ready, we can feature that as a link on here.

And then that would be best to open up in the browser.

That way, your app, you're not having to worry about credit card numbers, saving and storing those.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

The other limitation, your current app has some Bible integrations in it.

And that, again, with the here, the app is pulling...

It's from the website.

like, whatever we can put on the website, we can then feature on the app, but that Bible integration would not be something we can really feature on the website at this point.

So that would be, that's something we could explore as a, after we get this, this app out, Mike, we could explore that if adding in custom Bible integration into here, that is possible, but just not in the, you know, not in the price of the, of the basic app that we have here.

**Michael's iPhone:**

No, that's fine.

You're telling me it's doable.

We just have to, we have to, you know, pay a little more to get that integrated.

what you're saying, right?

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

And I would, with your timeframe, you know, like I would recommend, let's get the app launched as it, you know, let's get this polish and launch.

And then we can come back at whenever you guys would want, whether it's right away or later and, and make improvements to it.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

And don't even know what the, um, yeah, I've never really played with it here.

I don't know.

Oh, what the Bible integration, what's that, what that's integrated, if that's integrated into Blue Letter Bible or where it's being, where that whole little feature is being pulled from for the Subsplash app, I'm not sure.

I'm sure I could look into the Subsplash app and find, just so we know, you know, where this is coming from.

I don't even know where it's coming from.

Because there's a whole, if you look at the bottom of our current app, there's Bible, and then right next to it is the Blue Letter Bible.

So it's two different things.

Shows you how often I'm in my own app, you know.

But, yeah.

But that's one of those things, like, you know, if you link out to Bible Gateway already on the new app here, people would have their own Bible apps.

**Anthony Elliott:**

You can promote other people's Bible apps, you know, for free.

There's no extra cost there.

If you wanted to have an integration where the Bible isn't here, maybe you push out a daily verse to everyone, or you have a daily reading in here.

Or that's possible, and we could add that as a...

A small project, you know, a small feature.

**Michael's iPhone:**

I noticed on our current app, and I need to pull yours up again, we have a little feature down at the bottom of the current app that says Connect, and when you hit that, it gives you a link to Facebook, Instagram, our website, which is the app, a membership form.

There's a bunch of things you can do just by hitting that Connect button on the front.

**Anthony Elliott:**

I like that.

kind of like that.

**Adam Hardy:**

Get a Connect page, and we can use it to pull into the app.

Kind of have it as an app-only page.

It'd be on the website, but maybe we just don't make it visible.

People could come across it, and it would look fine.

If they did, we just wouldn't be promoting it necessarily on the website, and we could utilize it in the app.

So we could definitely replicate that.

I think that's a good idea.

Yeah.

So I think that does make sense for your app.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Looking at the tabs that we have here, we should replace one of those with Connect.

So we've got maybe to Get Involved, replace Get Involved with Connect.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, Connect would give you, and you can then have in this list of things, can have a Get Involved piece right there.

Right.

And that would take them there or, you know, whatever, a couple things there.

So anyway, I kind of like the way that works, and if we can retain something like that, that'd be great.

**Adam Hardy:**

Of course, yeah, we can do that.

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Anything else you're seeing here, Mike, that you'd like to call out?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Let me undo this a little bit here.

**Adam Hardy:**

From a design perspective, Anthony, I would make the logo smaller.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Well, who's here?

Okay.

How are you?

**Adam Hardy:**

Yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

From the real estate.

**Adam Hardy:**

Yeah.

Okay.

I'll catch up with you.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

I'm working in your office right now.

Yeah.

Yeah.

No, it's good.

Now, that FFC up in the upper left corner, what is that about?

**Anthony Elliott:**

Your existing app had that, so that...

Yeah, and I think it's...

**Michael's iPhone:**

I guess we don't have it.

**Anthony Elliott:**

I don't have it going across all the pages.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

Is that just there for looks?

Because what we had up there was our little Maltese Cross logo up in the upper left corner, and then it said FFC next to it, which if it's not functional, I'd rather just have the little logo up there, just because it looks cool.

It looks better than the...

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

So have the logo, but not the text.

Yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Just that Maltese Cross logo, which is not our full logo.

We like using that in certain places, and that's one of those places we like to use that.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Adam, do you know, do we have that logo file?

**Michael's iPhone:**

You should, if you don't.

**Adam Hardy:**

I think they sent it.

I will look for it.

Yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Send it to your way.

**Adam Hardy:**

Anthony.

Okay.

**Anthony Elliott:**

And then what else here?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Let me get back to it.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Sorry.

**Michael's iPhone:**

See here.

Scroll down again.

Yeah, I mean, the way it works, and I'm not trying to necessarily replicate our current app.

I'm just saying, you know, that's what I was asking.

How far, like our current app, you know, if I'm scrolling on the homepage, I pretty much see everything we have as far as like categories.

And then you go into any one of those, it's going to have more content.

So if I look at that, and we call them cards, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 13, 14, there's 15.

I of those cards that I scroll, but just on the homepage, I can see everything I want to maybe get to right there.

I mean, unless you say to me, oh, that's really bad design, it doesn't really bother me to go down and have those main categories all identified right on the homepage.

And then from there, I can navigate to other things that, you know, would underlie those.

And I'm not saying they have to be all of them.

I'm just saying whatever we choose.

Like, for instance, the way you have it set up right now, you've got the kind of what I would say, the header part with those main cards.

And then you have the featured and you have like three there, I can see us having more of those featured and not even calling them featured.

They're just kind of everything we have.

you.

**Adam Hardy:**

you.

Well,

**Michael's iPhone:**

And in terms of more of a category that, you know, again, mirroring the website at some level, I have to kind of see what that would do.

But does it bother you to maybe have more of those cards on the homepage?

That's probably what I'm asking.

Or what if we flipped?

**Adam Hardy:**

So instead of having up top, those kind of scroll, have the featured up top, and you can scroll through the featured and then have kind of your main cards scroll down.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, the featured would be something at the top that could be freshened up and changed here and there, and the stuff below that could be more the staples that we just always have up there.

**Adam Hardy:**

I that makes more sense to me, that way that you're promoting your new stuff on top.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, and again, the featured are more, they could be more of a general category that can then lead to a few more underlying.

**Adam Hardy:**

So maybe you're promoting a specific event there, maybe you're promoting a specific, you

You know, monthly media.

Yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

Yeah, that's good.

I like that, that we would kind of have the top end be new stuff.

So there's something fresh to look at when you get there.

And then the stuff below is kind of where they go to get stuff they know how to go.

like going in a supermarket, right?

They know what aisle to go into to get this, that, and that.

But the cool stuff that they want you to buy is always right there on the end caps, you know?

So maybe that's a good approach.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yes.

But new stuff on the top and evergreen content down below.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Ah, so yeah, there's a term, evergreen content.

I liked it.

I like terminology, Anthony.

**Adam Hardy:**

There you go.

**Anthony Elliott:**

I like to know the lingo, you know?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, that's good.

Yeah, and as far as like the bottoms, what's on the bottom there, I like the idea of a connect thing there.

We'll do that.

**Adam Hardy:**

you.

you.

you.

Thank Thank Thank

**Michael's iPhone:**

You know, and I don't know where you would put the, even Connect could lead you to the prayer request in the membership form really, really quick, you know.

And then we would probably want to have a Give icon down there, and I like the chapter icon down there.

Anyway, we can kind of play around with what's on the bottom there, but those would be a couple I think we'd want there.

I've probably given you enough to do already.

**Adam Hardy:**

That's quite a bit.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, yeah.

**Michael's iPhone:**

I got to get back to what I'm doing.

So what I think I might take away is to try to locate some of those audio files and see what we got to start working on as far as setting up to be able to get to those.

As a evergreen thing, those audio files.

And that's where, like you said, occasionally we can highlight a particular one and have it up on the, what would you call that top section, where it's more of the new stuff or the feature?

Featured, or maybe that's what you call it.

**Adam Hardy:**

You got to call it your featured hero area for new friends.

Yeah, there you go.

**Michael's iPhone:**

We get a new shirt to plug or a new ministry aid of some kind.

And that could lead you back to the store, right, if you hit that or something like that.

**Adam Hardy:**

Yeah, you can put a specific image in that has the shirt on it, and you could just, yeah, promote the store and send it to the store.

Yeah.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, like this one opens up to a website, a website.

So you could do the same thing.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

Great.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

I guess, Mike K., in terms of scheduling, is there any more to schedule?

I'm wondering, I mean, you've got enough to work on going forward.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Do you want to schedule out another review of this, or what would be best for you, Anthony?

**Michael's iPhone:**

I'm back on the 25th, so anything after that?

That works for you guys, we'll figure it out.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah, so let's try and schedule something for then.

And really, with the feedback that you've given, Mike, I think that my goal there would be, I'll have everything ready to go on the app at that point.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

How much time would two weeks be enough?

Because we're looking at two weeks out before Mike's back from his trip.

Does that give you enough time, or do we want to...

Push it to like the first week of February?

**Anthony Elliott:**

No, I think the two weeks sooner would be better.

Okay.

We're pushing up on our NRB event in February as well.

Yeah, more we can get done earlier, the better.

And just with timing, like if once we, Mike Bell, once you give approval on the app, there's going to be a significant process to get into the app store, or be able to transfer your existing account to our account, so you can...

**Michael's iPhone:**

And then Apple will have to approve it.

**Anthony Elliott:**

there's like a one to two week process once you get the green light for once the app can actually be ready to go.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah.

And just I think for our sake, you know, if we can have this up and running, our conference at Hume Lake is March 20, March 19th to the 22nd.

So I would love to have it up and running, you know, before we, that'd be a great place to reintroduce the app to everybody.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

for Mike K, correct me if I'm wrong on timing, but with our, I would need to have all the development done for sure by like February 15th.

Yeah.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

On my timeline.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

would say we definitely want to submit it to the App Store that probably third week of February at the latest.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Yeah.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

To give it plenty of time, especially to come back and say that something needs to be changed or updated.

And if we want to hit the deadlines for the retreat.

So let's schedule something out then for the week of the 26th.

Mike Bell, we're pretty wide open on 27th, 28th, 29th.

Do you have a preference?

**Michael's iPhone:**

29th.

29th would be a good day.

Yeah, 29th would be good.

Probably the 29th, we've got some time.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

These are Eastern time, which would be noon to probably 2 at the latest.

It would be Eastern time.

So for you, that would be 9 to 11 in the morning, just an hour slot there.

Or we could come back again at probably 4 o'clock Eastern time, which would be 1 o'clock your time.

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, let's do the 9, or let's do 10 a.m.

our time, whatever it is for you.

California time.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Mike, you need a handy little tool to have client, you know, Mike Bell's time zone, our time zone.

You know, Google Calendar does allow me to set up one additional time zone.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

So I always just do central, but I do have to do a little bit of math for our Pacific Coast.

And Anthony, do have a, it looks like a personal thing during that time, but I'm assuming I can schedule a lot of that.

**Anthony Elliott:**

Oh, let me make sure.

It's just family, it's a family lunch slot.

Yeah, that's fine.

All right.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

All right, so 1 o'clock Eastern time, which would be 10 o'clock Pacific time.

Yep.

Perfect.

And we've got that scheduled for Thursday the 29th.

Thank you.

Very good.

Mike, we'll wait.

As far as the website stuff that I had mentioned earlier, let's just wait until you get the chance to review the whole site, because I'm sure there might be more questions, but get that review in by the 20th, and we'll be plugging away on the website, and then we'll reconvene once you get back, okay?

**Michael's iPhone:**

Yeah, and if you wanted to put something on the books for that specific topic, it could probably be the same date, you know, bump it up.

I mean, however you want to work it out.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Yeah, well, let's see what the feedback, let's see if we can do it async, right, so just through comments, and if there's any outstanding questions, we can certainly touch base on it at the same time, so.

**Michael's iPhone:**

All right.

Sounds good.

**Mike Kaczorowski:**

Safe travels, Mike.

Thanks so much for meeting with us.

**Michael's iPhone:**

All right.

Thank you, guys.

Appreciate it.

Have a good one.

Bye-bye.

See ya.
