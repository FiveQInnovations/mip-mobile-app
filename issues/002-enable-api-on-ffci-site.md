# Enable API on the real FFCI site

## Context
Currently need to run a local server to test the mobile app. Need to enable the mobile API on the production FFCI site (`ws-ffci-copy`) so that local development/testing doesn't require running a local Kirby instance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Configure mobile API settings in Kirby Panel
- [ ] Set up API key/authentication
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Test mobile app connection to production API
- [ ] Document API endpoint URL and credentials

## Notes
Good progress has been made on this, but may not be fully complete yet.
