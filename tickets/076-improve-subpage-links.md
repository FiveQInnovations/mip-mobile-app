# Make Subpage Links More Obvious

## Context

From the Jan 13, 2026 meeting with Anthony Elliott, subpage links on content pages (like the About page) need to be more visually obvious and tappable. Currently they need "a little bit of love" to make it clearer they are clickable.

## Goals

1. Improve visual design of subpage links
2. Make clickable elements more obvious to users
3. Enhance navigation experience on content pages

## Acceptance Criteria

- Subpage links are clearly identifiable as clickable
- Visual cues indicate tappable elements
- Improved user experience on content pages
- Links maintain accessibility standards
- Design is consistent across all content pages

## Notes

- This affects pages like About, Resources, etc.
- Low priority polish item
- Focus on visual hierarchy and interaction design
