# Run Android Emulator Reliably Locally

## Context
Need to ensure Android emulator runs reliably for local development and testing. Current setup may have issues with emulator startup, device management, or build installation. Explore Expo Orbit as a potential solution for simplifying emulator management and build deployment.

**Reference:** https://docs.expo.dev/build/orbit/

## Tasks
- [ ] Document current Android emulator issues/limitations
- [ ] Verify Android Studio and Android SDK are properly installed
- [ ] Research Expo Orbit capabilities for Android emulator management
- [ ] Install Expo Orbit: `brew install expo-orbit` (macOS)
- [ ] Configure Orbit to launch on login (optional)
- [ ] Test Orbit's ability to list and launch Android emulators
- [ ] Test installing and launching EAS builds on emulator via Orbit
- [ ] Test installing local APK files via Orbit drag-and-drop
- [ ] Compare Orbit workflow vs manual emulator management
- [ ] Document reliable emulator startup and management process
- [ ] Explore running Android emulators without audio if needed
