# Integrate Audio Sermons Collection

## Context

From the Jan 13, 2026 meeting with Mike Bell, the app needs to integrate popular audio sermons that were in their old Subsplash app but are not currently on the website. These include top-performing content like "Motorhome Adventure" by David Gibbs.

## Goals

1. Integrate audio sermons collection into the app
2. Make popular sermon content accessible to users
3. Maintain consistency with existing app content structure

## Acceptance Criteria

- Audio sermons collection is accessible in the app
- Popular sermons are available (top 30-40 based on metrics)
- Audio playback functions correctly
- Content integrates seamlessly with app design
- Sermons load from website collection

## Notes

- Sermons are popular content from old Subsplash app
- Mike will provide top-performing sermon files based on metrics
- Adam needs to create the website collection first
- This is a high priority feature requested by Mike
