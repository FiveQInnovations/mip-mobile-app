# Homepage Layout Redesign - Flip Featured/Evergreen Sections

## Context

From the Jan 13, 2026 meeting with Mike Bell, the homepage layout needs to be redesigned. Currently, the layout has Evergreen content (core resources) at the top and Featured content below. This should be flipped so Featured content is at the top (for fresh/promotional content) and Evergreen content is below (for static core resources).

## Goals

1. Flip the homepage layout to put Featured content at the top
2. Keep Evergreen content below for familiar navigation
3. Maintain responsive design on mobile devices

## Acceptance Criteria

- Featured hero section displays at the top with fresh/promotional content
- Evergreen section with core resources displays below
- Layout maintains responsive design on mobile devices

## Notes

- This mirrors the supermarket "end cap" analogy Mike mentioned - new stuff at top, familiar navigation below
- Aligns with user expectations from existing FFCI app experience
- This was a key feedback item from the Jan 13 meeting
