# Header Logo - Replace Default Logo with Maltese Cross

## Context

From the Jan 13, 2026 meeting with Mike Bell, the persistent header should use the Maltese Cross logo instead of the current "FFC" text. Mike stated: "what we had up there was our little Maltese Cross logo up in the upper left corner, and then it said FFC next to it, which if it's not functional, I'd rather just have the little logo up there, just because it looks cool."

## Goals

1. Replace the "FFC" text in the header with just the Maltese Cross logo
2. Maintain header functionality and styling

## Acceptance Criteria

- Maltese Cross logo appears in the header upper left corner
- "FFC" text is removed (replaced by logo only)
- Logo is properly sized and positioned
- Header functionality remains intact
- Design maintains visual consistency

## Notes

- This is a separate task from making the large homepage logo smaller
- Maltese Cross logo file needed from Adam Hardy
- Michael specifically wants "just the little logo up there" without the text
