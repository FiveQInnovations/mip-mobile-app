# Header Logo - Replace Default Logo with Maltese Cross

## Context

From the Jan 13, 2026 meeting with Mike Bell, the persistent header should use the Maltese Cross logo instead of the current "FFC" text. Mike prefers this look.

## Goals

1. Replace the default logo at the far left of the screen with the Maltese Cross logo
2. Maintain header functionality and styling

## Acceptance Criteria

- Maltese Cross logo appears in the header instead of "FFC" text
- Logo is properly sized and positioned
- Header functionality remains intact
- Design maintains visual consistency

## Notes

- This is a separate task from making the large homepage logo smaller
- Maltese Cross logo file needed from Adam Hardy
