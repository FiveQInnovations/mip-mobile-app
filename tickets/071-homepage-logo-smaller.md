# Homepage Logo - Make Firefighters for Christ Logo Smaller

## Context

From the Jan 13, 2026 meeting with Mike Bell, the large "Firefighters for Christ" logo on the homepage should be made smaller to save screen real estate and improve the overall design.

## Goals

1. Reduce the size of the large "Firefighters for Christ" logo on the homepage
2. Optimize screen real estate usage
3. Maintain logo readability and brand recognition

## Acceptance Criteria

- Homepage logo is visibly smaller than current size
- Logo remains readable and recognizable
- Screen real estate is better utilized for content
- Design maintains visual hierarchy

## Notes

- This is separate from the header logo change
- Logo should still be prominent but less dominating
- Consider responsive design across different screen sizes
