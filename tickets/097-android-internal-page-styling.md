# Android Internal Page Styling

## Context

Internal content pages need visual improvements. The current rendering of page content could be enhanced with better typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy for headings, paragraphs, and dividers.

## Goals

1. Improve visual presentation of internal page content
2. Better typography hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, body text)
3. Add visual dividers/separators where appropriate
4. Consistent spacing and padding

## Acceptance Criteria

- Headings are visually distinct and properly sized
- Body text is readable with appropriate line height
- Dividers/separators help organize content sections
- Images display properly with appropriate sizing
- Links are styled and tappable
- Overall design matches iOS app quality

## Notes

- Content comes from Kirby CMS as structured data
- May involve parsing and rendering different block types
- Consider using Material Design 3 typography scale
