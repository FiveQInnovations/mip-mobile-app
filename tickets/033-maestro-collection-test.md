# Maestro Test: Collection Grid and Navigation

## Context
The spec requires Maestro test coverage for collections. Need to verify collection grid displays and items are tappable.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `collection.yaml` Maestro flow
- [ ] Navigate to a collection page
- [ ] Assert collection grid/list is visible
- [ ] Assert collection items are displayed
- [ ] Tap on a collection item
- [ ] Verify item detail page opens
- [ ] Take screenshot for documentation

## Notes
- Per spec: "Collection - Collection grid displays, items are tappable"
- Depends on having working collection display (tickets 024-025)
- Should work on both iOS and Android
