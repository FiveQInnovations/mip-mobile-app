# Send App Transfer Process Info to Mike K.

## Context

From FFCI App Build Review meeting (Jan 29, 2026). Need to send Mike information about the app transfer process from Subsplash to FFCI's new app.

## Goals

1. Document app transfer process details
2. Send information to Mike Kaczorowski
3. Provide guidance on store-to-store publisher transfer vs new app launch

## Acceptance Criteria

- Mike receives app transfer process documentation
- Information includes both ideal path (store-to-store transfer) and fallback (new app launch)
- Process details are clear and actionable

## Notes

- Ideal path: Subsplash initiates store-to-store publisher transfer (retains installs/reviews, auto-updates users)
- Fallback: Launch new app and sunset old one
- Requires Subsplash cooperation for ideal path
- Anthony found it's technically possible
