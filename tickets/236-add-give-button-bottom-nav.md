# Add Give Button to Bottom Nav; Remove Media

## Context

From FFCI App Build Review meeting (Jan 29, 2026). Team prefers adding Give button to bottom navigation and removing Media tab (Media can be accessed via Featured/Resources).

## Goals

1. Add Give button to bottom navigation
2. Remove Media from bottom navigation tabs
3. Ensure Media remains accessible via Featured/Resources

## Acceptance Criteria

- Give button appears in bottom navigation
- Media tab removed from bottom nav
- Media content still accessible through Featured section or Resources
- Navigation feels balanced and intuitive

## Notes

- Current tabs: Home, Resources, Media, Connect
- New tabs: Home, Resources, Connect, Give
- Five tabs may feel cramped; needs testing with short labels
- Part of navigation redesign
