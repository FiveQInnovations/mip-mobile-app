# Scrollable Cards - Add Scroll Indicators

## Context

From the Jan 13, 2026 meeting with Mike Bell, the horizontal scrollable cards in the Quick Tasks section look "awkward" with half a card showing. Visual cues are needed to indicate scrollability.

## Goals

1. Add visual indicators to show cards are scrollable
2. Improve user experience with horizontal scrolling
3. Make scrollable content more discoverable

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clear visual indicators show content is scrollable
- Options to implement:
  - Arrow indicators
  - Partial card visibility with proper styling
  - Other visual cues to indicate scrollability
- Cards maintain consistent sizing and spacing
- Improved user experience for horizontal scrolling

## Notes

- Currently looks "awkward" with half-card showing
- Blocked by design input from Adam Hardy
- May involve making cards same size as featured cards
