# Add "Connect" Tab - Replace "Get Involved"

## Context

From the Jan 13, 2026 meeting with Mike Bell, the bottom navigation should replace the "Get Involved" tab with a "Connect" tab to centralize key social media and form links. This mirrors a popular feature from their existing Subsplash app.

## Goals

1. Replace "Get Involved" tab with "Connect" tab in bottom navigation
2. Centralize key links in the Connect section
3. Improve user access to social media and forms

## Acceptance Criteria

- "Get Involved" tab is replaced with "Connect" tab
- Connect tab includes links to:
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - Website
  - Membership form
  - Prayer request
  - Give
- Navigation functions correctly
- Tab bar displays properly on mobile

## Notes

- This is a high priority change requested by Mike Bell
- Mirrors the Connect feature from their existing app
- May require creating a Connect page on the website first
