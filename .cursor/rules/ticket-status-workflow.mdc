description: "Ticket status workflow - agents can only move to QA, not Done"

- Ticket status workflow: `backlog` → `in-progress` → `qa` → `done`
- Agents are ONLY allowed to move tickets to `qa` status when work is complete
- Agents MUST NOT move tickets to `done` status - only the user can mark tickets as done
- This ensures the user reviews all completed work before marking it complete
- When a ticket is ready for review, change status to `qa` and note that it's ready for QA
