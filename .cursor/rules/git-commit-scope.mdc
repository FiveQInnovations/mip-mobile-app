description: "Keep commits scoped to the correct project directories"

- Stage and commit only within the appropriate project area:
 - `astro-prototype/` for the Astro PWA
 - `rn-mobile-app/` for the React Native mobile app
- Check file paths before `git add` to avoid cross-project commits.
- Do not stage unrelated or untracked folders unless explicitly requested.
- Note that I have repos from different areas on my filesystem here:
 - ws-ffci: /Users/anthony/mip/sites/ws-ffci
 - wsp-mobile: /Users/anthony/mip/fiveq-plugins/wsp-mobile
 - wsp-forms: /Users/anthony/mip/fiveq-plugins/wsp-forms
