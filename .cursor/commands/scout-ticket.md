## Scouting

## Ticket Parameter
You will be given a Ticket as a parameter. This could be a file, a ticket number, or a description of the ticket. Use this parameter to find the right ticket in the `tickets` folder. Consult the tickets/README.md for an overview.

# Instructions for Scouting Agent
Research this ticket. DO NOT modify code for this phase. I have a primary builder agent working on the app code and tests.

You are researching this ticket so that the builder can complete it more quickly when it gets there. Add findings to the ticket. Commit the ticket only when done.

Note that in the workspace I now have the Kirby site and content at `ws-ffci`, and the API plugin at `wsp-mobile`. And the `wsp-forms` plugin which powers the Kirby/Vue forms. These are all in different directories.
