# Test Tab Heading Verification
#
# Verifies that the "Test" tab displays the expected heading:
# "Prayer & Fruit: Black Text on White Background"

- launchApp
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Navigate to Test tab
- tapOn:
    text: "Test"
    
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Verify the screen title appears
- assertVisible:
    text: "Test Background"

# Verify the main heading is visible
- assertVisible:
    text: "Prayer & Fruit: Black Text on White Background"

# Take screenshot to visually verify "Doctrinal Statement" section
# Visual inspection confirms: "Doctrinal Statement: White Text on Blue Background" is NOT visible
# The section either isn't rendering or has white text on white background (invisible)
# This documents the bug: section background colors not working in iOS
- takeScreenshot:
    path: "maestro/screenshots/test-tab-doctrinal-statement-visibility"

# Note: Screenshot review shows:
# - "Prayer & Fruit" section is visible (black text on white - working)
# - "Doctrinal Statement" section is NOT visible (should be white text on blue background)
# This confirms section background colors are not rendering in iOS WebView
