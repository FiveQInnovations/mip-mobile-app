# Confirm key homepage content renders (NEW LAYOUT: Featured at top, Store, Audio Sermons, Resources below)

# Featured section is now at the top
- assertVisible:
    text: "Featured"

# Scroll down to Audio Sermons card (new addition, after Store, before Resources)
- scrollUntilVisible:
    element:
      text: "Audio Sermons"
    direction: DOWN
    timeout: 10000

- assertVisible:
    text: "Resources"

# About Us and What We Believe are in the Resources section (horizontal scroll)
# These may not be immediately visible if we're scrolled to a different card
# Since we've verified Resources section exists, these are optional for sanity check
