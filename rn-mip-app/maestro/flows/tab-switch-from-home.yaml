# Setup
- runFlow: _setup.yaml

# Tap on Resources Quick Task (which should be a tab)
- tapOn:
    id: "home-quick-resources"
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Verify tab bar is still visible
- assertVisible: "Home tab"
- assertVisible: "Resources tab"

# Verify Resources tab is selected (we can check selected state if we had a way, but visibility is good enough)
# Also check for Resources content
- assertVisible: "Resources"
