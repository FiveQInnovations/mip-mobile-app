# Search functionality test for iOS
# Tests that search works correctly and results appear in reasonable time
# 
# Note: launchApp is NOT used - app is launched by script with xcrun simctl
# App should be launched with xcrun simctl before running this test:
#   xcrun simctl launch booted com.fiveq.ffci

# Wait for app to load
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Confirm homepage is loaded
# Verify search icon is visible (confirms header is rendered)
- assertVisible:
    id: "search-outline"

# Tap the search icon in the header
- tapOn:
    id: "search-outline"
    index: 0

# Wait for search screen to appear
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Verify search input is visible and focused
- assertVisible:
    text: "Search..."

# Type a search query (common term that should return results)
- inputText: "firefighter"

# Wait for search results to appear (should be fast with caching)
# Give it up to 3 seconds for first search, but expect it faster
- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 3000

# Verify search results are displayed
# Should see at least one result with "firefighter" or related content
- assertVisible:
    text: "firefighter"

# Verify we're seeing search results (not empty state)
- assertNotVisible:
    text: "No results found"

# Test that typing another query works (should use cache if same query)
- tapOn:
    text: "firefighter"
    index: 0

# Clear the search input
- eraseText
- inputText: "chaplain"

# Wait for new search results
- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 3000

# Verify new search results appear
- assertVisible:
    text: "chaplain"

# Test clearing search
- tapOn:
    id: "close-circle"

# Verify we're back to empty state
