# Simple Android homepage verification
# No setup flow needed - simplified for Android
# 
# Note: launchApp may not work reliably - if test fails, launch app manually first:
#   adb shell am start -n com.fiveq.ffci/.MainActivity
# Then run the test (it will work without launchApp if app is already running)

# App should be launched with adb before running this test:
#   adb shell am force-stop com.fiveq.ffci && adb shell am start -n com.fiveq.ffci/.MainActivity
