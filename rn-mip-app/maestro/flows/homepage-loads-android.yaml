# Simple Android homepage verification
# No setup flow needed - simplified for Android

# Note: launchApp may not work reliably - if test fails, launch app manually first:
#   adb shell am start -n com.fiveq.ffci/.MainActivity
# Then run the test (it will work without launchApp if app is already running)
