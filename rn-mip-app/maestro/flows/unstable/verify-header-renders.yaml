# Wait for app to load
- waitForAnimationToEnd
# Wait for homepage to load (Featured section indicates homepage is ready)
# This ensures we're on the homepage before checking for the search icon
- extendedWaitUntil:

    timeout: 10000
# Verify search icon is visible in header
- assertVisible:
    id: "search-outline"
