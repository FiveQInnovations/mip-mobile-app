# Cursor Usage Tracking

Tracking Cursor API usage and costs for this project.

## Usage History

### 2025-12-24 (Start)
$13.71 in included usage, no overage

### 2025-12-29 (Morning)
- **Status**: $20 of included usage, no overage
- **Notes**: Starting point
I didn't do much this day, just ~30 minutes

Current pattern has been to create a Plan using Opus 4.5 and then build it with Composer.
Composer also had a lot of free extra usage during this time.

$20 - $13 = $7 for this period

### 2026-01-02 (Morning)
- **Status**: $288 in overage
- **Notes**: Significant usage increase over ~4 days
The jump from $20 to $288 was NOT due to this project. Instead it was from the Journity Dashboard security vulnerability.

### 2026-01-03 (End of day)
- $430 in overage
- I did explore using some cheaper models a few times like gemini 3 flash, but they took longer and I found I had to resort to Opus 4.5 to clean up anyways. Even Composer 1 was not as good as Opus 4.5. Composer 1 was good at building, but Opus was better at thinking through complex problems and simplifying it down into a handful of manageable todos. Opus was also better at solving complex obstacles that came up during development.
I did try Gemini 3 Pro on a specific hard bug and it did well.
I also tried Codex 5.1 a couple times on that hard bug and more typical problems and it seemed like it would have done fine given time, but it took noticeably longer to actually solve problems than Opus.

$430 - $288 = $142 for this weekend.
